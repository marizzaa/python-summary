    "\n",
    "- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.).\n",
    "- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "- Python's syntax allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning code can be executed as soon as it is written, making prototyping very quick.\n",
    "- Python can be treated in a **procedural**, **object-oriented**, or **functional** way."

    "- **Python 2**, while not being updated with new features (only security updates), is still popular.\n",
    "- In this tutorial, Python will be written in a text editor. However, it is also possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as **Thonny**, **PyCharm**, **NetBeans**, or **Eclipse**, which are particularly useful for managing larger collections of Python files."

    "- Python was designed for readability and has similarities to the English language, with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "- Python uses new lines to complete commands, unlike other programming languages that often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "- Python relies on **indentation** using whitespace to define scope, such as the scope of loops, functions, and classes. Other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.\n"
